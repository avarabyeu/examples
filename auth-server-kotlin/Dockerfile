# We added a VOLUME pointing to "/tmp" because
# that is where a Spring Boot application creates
# working directories for Tomcat by default.
# The effect is to create a temporary file on your
# host under "/var/lib/docker" and link it to the
# container under "/tmp". This step is optional for the simple
# app that we wrote here, but can be necessary for other Spring Boot applications
# if they need to actually write in the filesystem.
VOLUME /tmp


ADD build/libs/auth-server-kotlin.jar /app.jar

# You can use a RUN command to "touch" the jar file
# so that it has a file modification time
# (Docker creates all container files in an "unmodified" state by default).
# This actually isnâ€™t important for the simple app that we wrote,
# but any static content (e.g. "index.html") would require the
# file to have a modification time.
#RUN sh -c 'touch /app.jar'

EXPOSE 8181

# To reduce Tomcat startup time we added a system property
# pointing to "/dev/urandom" as a source of entropy.
